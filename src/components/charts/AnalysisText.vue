			Music shapes our lives, reflecting our moods, personalities, and
			memories. <span id="text-1">I've chosen to
				introduce myself through the lens of my musical tastes</span>, quantified objectively
			here. My
			analysis is based on my swimming playlist.

		</p>
		<p>
			According to <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3250/3118"
			   target="_blank">research</a>, people tend to be particularly fond of music from their
			teenage
			years. And I happen to be no exception: My musical taste is largely <span id="text-2">contemporary,
				dominated
				by the sounds of the last two decades</span>.

		</p>
		<p>
			The musician Faber is objectivly my <span id="text-3">favourite artist</span> with 35
			songs, closely followed
			by AnnenMayKantereit.
			This selection reflects my general favourite genres:<span id="text-4"> alternative, hip-hop,
				pop and indie</span> - all with a strong german influence.

		</p>
		<p>
			The overall <span id="text-5">mood of my playlist</span> tends to be danceable and
			melancholic, with a preference for
			energetic over relaxed and electronic over acoustic sounds.
		</p>

		<p>I enjoy weaving my musical tastes into my memories by creating videos that align with my mood
			and music.</p>

		<p>
			Now you know me <span id="text-7" style="padding-top: 10px">a little better</span>
